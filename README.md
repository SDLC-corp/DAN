# **Data Geometry (DAN)**

**Enterprise-Grade Intelligent Document Processing Platform**

Data Geometry (DAN) is a **next-generation Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) platform** designed to convert **unstructured documents, scanned files, handwriting, tables, graphs, and engineering drawings** into **validated, structured, enterprise-ready data**.

Unlike traditional OCR or RPA tools, DAN combines **AI-driven document understanding, confidence-based validation, human-in-the-loop governance, and enterprise system integration** into a single, unified platform.

---

## **What DAN Does**

DAN takes documents from any source and turns them into **trusted enterprise data**:

```
Documents → AI Understanding → Validation → Review (if needed) → ERP / CRM → Analytics
```

DAN is designed for **Finance, Banking, Insurance, Logistics, Utilities, Tax, and Commercial Real Estate**, where accuracy, auditability, and compliance matter as much as automation.

---

## **Core Capabilities**

### **Multi-Modal Document Intelligence**

DAN understands more than just text:

* PDFs and scanned images
* Tables and line items
* Handwritten forms
* Receipts
* Graphs and charts
* Engineering drawings and symbols

---

### **AI-Powered Extraction**

DAN uses multiple AI models working together:

* OCR & layout analysis
* Document classification
* Key-value extraction
* Table & line-item extraction
* Handwriting recognition
* Graph & symbol digitization

All extracted data is returned with **confidence scores and visual evidence**.

---

### **Confidence-Driven Automation**

Every extracted field is scored.
DAN automatically decides:

* **High confidence → Straight-Through Processing (STP)**
* **Low confidence → Human Review**

This enables:

* 80–95% automation
* Human verification only where needed
* Continuous learning from corrections

---

### **Human-in-the-Loop Verification**

A built-in review UI allows:

* Side-by-side document and extracted data
* Field-level corrections
* Table corrections
* Full audit trail of who changed what and when

---

### **Enterprise Integration**

DAN connects directly to:

* **SAP**
* **Oracle**
* **Salesforce**
* **Any ERP or CRM**
* **APIs**
* **CSV**
* **FTP / SFTP**
* **Webhooks**

With:

* Idempotency
* Retry handling
* Reconciliation
* Audit-ready posting

---

### **Governance, Security & Compliance**

DAN is designed for regulated environments:

* Role-based access control (RBAC)
* Tenant and department isolation
* Encryption in transit and at rest
* Immutable audit logs
* Data retention and deletion controls
* ISO / SOC / GDPR-ready architecture

---

## **Use Cases**

DAN is used in production for:

* **Invoice Processing (Accounts Payable)**

| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **SaaS**            | Multi-tenant managed platform                 |
| **Dedicated Cloud** | Single-tenant deployment in isolated VPC/VNet |
| **On-Premise**      | Deployed inside customer data centers         |

All models support:

* Secure networking
* Data isolation
* Auto-scaling
* Enterprise integrations

---

## **High-Level Architecture**

DAN is built as a layered microservices platform:

```
Experience Layer (UI, Review)
↓
Platform & Orchestration
↓
Document AI Runtime
↓
Validation & Confidence
↓
Human-in-the-Loop
↓
Enterprise Integration
↓
Data & Audit Stores
↓
Security, Governance & Monitoring
```

Each layer scales independently for performance, cost, and compliance.
